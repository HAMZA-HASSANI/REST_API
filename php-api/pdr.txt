Here‚Äôs a Product Requirements Document (PRD) template for a REST API. This version is generic but tailored for a typical web application backend, and you can customize it based on your domain (e.g., e-commerce, finance, education, etc.).

üìù Product Requirements Document (PRD) ‚Äì REST API
1. Overview
Title: REST API for [Your Product Name]
Author: [Your Name]
Date: [Date]
Version: 1.0

Purpose:
To design and implement a RESTful API that allows clients to interact with the backend services of [Your Product Name] through standardized HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE). This API will serve as the core integration point for frontends, mobile apps, and third-party services.

2. Goals and Objectives
Provide a scalable, secure, and well-documented REST API.

Support core features such as user management, authentication, and domain-specific resources.

Ensure adherence to REST principles and standard HTTP status codes.

Facilitate easy integration for internal and external developers.

3. Scope
In Scope:
User Registration and Authentication (JWT-based)

CRUD for domain entities (e.g., Products, Orders, Posts, etc.)

Role-based Access Control

Pagination, filtering, and sorting

Error handling and logging

API versioning (e.g., /api/v1/)

Out of Scope:
GraphQL endpoints

Admin dashboard

Real-time communication (WebSockets)

4. API Endpoints
4.1 Authentication
Method	Endpoint	Description	Auth Required
POST	/auth/register	Register new user	No
POST	/auth/login	Login and return JWT	No
POST	/auth/logout	Logout user	Yes

4.2 Users
Method	Endpoint	Description	Auth Required
GET	/users/me	Get current user info	Yes
PUT	/users/me	Update user info	Yes
DELETE	/users/me	Delete user account	Yes

4.3 [Resource: Products]
Method	Endpoint	Description	Auth Required
GET	/products	List all products	No
GET	/products/:id	Get product details	No
POST	/products	Create product	Yes (Admin)
PUT	/products/:id	Update product	Yes (Admin)
DELETE	/products/:id	Delete product	Yes (Admin)

5. Authentication & Security
Token-based authentication using JWT.

Endpoints requiring authentication must include Authorization: Bearer <token> in headers.

Role-based permissions (admin, user, moderator).

Rate limiting: e.g., 100 requests per IP per minute.

HTTPS only.

6. Data Models (Simplified)
User

json
Copier
Modifier
{
  "id": "uuid",
  "email": "string",
  "password": "hashed",
  "role": "user | admin",
  "createdAt": "datetime",
  "updatedAt": "datetime"
}
Product

json
Copier
Modifier
{
  "id": "uuid",
  "name": "string",
  "description": "string",
  "price": "decimal",
  "createdAt": "datetime",
  "updatedAt": "datetime"
}
7. Error Handling
Use consistent JSON structure for errors:

json
Copier
Modifier
{
  "error": "Invalid credentials",
  "code": 401
}
Common status codes:

200 OK

201 Created

400 Bad Request

401 Unauthorized

403 Forbidden

404 Not Found

500 Internal Server Error

8. Rate Limiting & Throttling
Authenticated users: 1000 req/hr

Anonymous users: 100 req/hr

9. Monitoring & Logging
Log every request and response code

Log authentication attempts

Set up alerts on high error rates or latency
